                    <strong>"Start with the end in mind"</strong> - is a useful concept to keep in mind when starting any project, and creating a new website is no exception.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Our approach is simple, using this concept and adding<strong>&nbsp;"...for whom?"</strong>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When designing a website it is critical to consider whom you're designing it for - you can do this by adopting a human centered design approach.  By defining the customer experience - the customer 'journey' -
                    you can capture the touch points your organisation has with them on that journey and influence the design accordingly.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Walking a mile in your customer's shoes helps better understand their wants and needs and leads to a considered design, underpinned with logic which can be reviewed when assessing
                    if your website is achieiving the objectives you originally defined. For this reason our approach is made up of four key steps outlined below alongwith their key purpose:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Design - key steps and purpose:</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Understand - to define your objectives and using your insights to better understand and empathsise with your target audience</li>
                            <li>Specify - to craft a clear statement which sets out your primary challenge and problem statement</li>
                            <li>Blueprint - to create ideas, explore them and agree which to take forwards</li>
                            <li>Make - to prototype the selected idea(s)</li>
                            <li>Test - to solicit feedback from potential customer's and validate or revise assumptions</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                </ul>
